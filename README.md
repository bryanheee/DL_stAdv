# Spatially Transformed Adversarial Examples (stAdv) Reproduction

This project aims to reproduce the paper [Spatially Transformed Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02612) (Xiao, C., Zhu, J., Li, B., He, W., Liu, M., & Song, D.),
where they introduce a new method for attacking deep neural networks so that they misclassify adversarial examples.

## Requirements

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

All of our code is located in the Jupyter Notebook `stAdv.ipynb`. To run the notebook, you need to have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed.

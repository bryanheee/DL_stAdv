# Spatially Transformed Adversarial Examples (stAdv) Reproduction

This project aims to reproduce the paper [Spatially Transformed Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02612) (Xiao, C., Zhu, J., Li, B., He, W., Liu, M., & Song, D.), 
where they introduce a new method for attacking deep neural networks so that they misclassify adversarial examples.
